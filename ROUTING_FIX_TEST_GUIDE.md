## 📋 **Test Plan**

### ✅ **Test 1: Manager Login & Admin Requests Page**
**Expected Result**: No more "page could not be found" error

1. **Navigate** to: https://payment-management-hbbag7fn6-bunchuai123s-projects.vercel.app/login
2. **Login** as manager: 
   - Email: `manager@example.com`
   - Password: `manager123`
3. **Click** "All Requests" in the sidebar navigation
4. **Verify**: You should see the new admin requests page with:
   - Statistics cards (Total, Pending, Approved, Rejected)
   - Filter buttons (All, Pending, Approved, Rejected)
   - List of all payment requests
   - "View Details" buttons for each request

### ✅ **Test 2: Individual Request Approval**
**Expected Result**: Approval pages work correctly

1. From the admin requests page, **click** "View Details" on any request
2. **Verify**: The individual request details page loads without errors
3. **Check**: If the request is pending, you should see approval buttons
4. **Test**: Try approving or rejecting a request (if available)

### ✅ **Test 3: Employee Access**
**Expected Result**: Employees see their own requests properly

1. **Logout** from manager account
2. **Login** as employee:
   - Email: `test@example.com` 
   - Password: `testpassword123`
3. **Navigate** to "My Requests"
4. **Verify**: Employee can see their own requests and details

### ✅ **Test 4: Navigation Routes**
**Expected Result**: All navigation links work

1. **Test** all sidebar navigation links:
   - Dashboard ✓
   - My Requests ✓ 
   - New Request ✓
   - All Requests (manager/admin only) ✓
   - Analytics ✓
   - Settings ✓

## 🚨 **What Was Fixed**

### **Root Cause**
- The navigation included a link to `/admin/requests` for HR and admin users
- This page didn't exist in the codebase, causing 404 errors

### **Solution Applied**
1. ✅ **Created** `/admin/requests` page with full functionality
2. ✅ **Added** `vercel.json` for proper routing configuration
3. ✅ **Updated** `next.config.ts` for production optimization
4. ✅ **Verified** build process includes new page
